# Lightspeed

Lightspeed is a minimalist typing application that aims to increase typing speed.
It is inspired by monkeytype. I chose to create this because I adored the monkeytype
application and wanted to create my own version and also learn the React library.

There are 3 options available: words, paragraphs and custom.

Words: Type random words in succession (no punctuation)

Paragraphs: Type paragraphs from movies/books (with punctuation)

Custom: Create your own input

At the end of each test, you will be presented your WPM (words typed per minute) and a graph
that will describe your WPM and EPM (errors typed per minute)

You can also change the theme and the font in the settings page
